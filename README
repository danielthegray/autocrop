This is a package to crop smaller photos out of a larger image. The
typical use would be to load a scanner with several photos, and let
this code find the photos and save them independently.

Also included is a simple linux command-line script to initiate a scan
and handle the cropping. It should be considered a demonstration of the
package, not a utility for general wide-spread use.
